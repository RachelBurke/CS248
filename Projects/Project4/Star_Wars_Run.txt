Welcome to the Star Wars Mash-Up!
Thank you for agreeing to fight against the evil Jabba the Hutt.
The galaxy has had enough of him and has decided it is time for Jabba to go.
Your job is to search the galaxy for Jabba, but BEWARE of the obstacles in your path:
The Death Star has been planning to destroy one of the planets.
There are stormtroopers patrolling one of the planets.
You have been banned from one of the planets in the galaxy and the technology in your
spacecraft will transport you do a different planet if you try to enter the area.
Your blaster is not up to the times and can only hold 3 shots.
To refill you must travel to your base planet.
The technology in your spacecraft only detects the three closest planets.
Sucks to have so many things against you, but maybe you can still kill Jabba.
Good Luck!
