**Professor: Dr. Jon Sorenson** </br>
**Jan - May 2017**

This repository contains files from my CS248 course taken in the Spring of 2017 at Butler University. It contains course some notes (in-class programs with comments) and projects completed during the course.

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to object-oriented programming using Java. Topics include algorithm analysis, recursion, the stack, queue, tree, and heap data structures, sorting algorithms, and GUI programming. A brief survey of computer science is also included: history, software engineering, computer organization, operating systems, networks, programming languages, databases, artificial intelligence, and theory. Prerequisites: CS142 or equivalent and CS151. (U)(5)
